The "BrushTalk" device is designed to enhance daily routines by allowing users to exchange voice messages while brushing their teeth.
Mounted on bathroom mirrors, BrushTalk enables users to record messages up to three minutes long and send them to another device. Each device features a user-friendly interface, high-quality microphone, and speaker for easy recording, sending, and playback of messages. Additionally, an LED indicator shows whether a new message is available. BrushTalk aims to transform the mundane task of brushing teeth into an opportunity for personal connection, fostering closer relationships and making daily routines more enjoyable.
